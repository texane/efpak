efpak: embedded firmware packaging

EFPAK (embedded firmware package) packages contain data that are parts
of device firmware upgrade operations. The EFPAK format packages data
blocks in a single container. Data can be of various type:
. EFPAK format related information,
. regular files to be stored in a filesystem,
. individual disk partition of full disk images.

The format itself is close to the ZIP format, and favor rapid iteration
over individual data blocks, and allows for an efficient implementation
in memory constraint environments. Also, data larger than 4GB can be handled.

Individual data blocks can be compressed. Currently, the DEFLATE compression
algorithm is used.

A tool called efpak allows to manage packages. Available commands include:
. creation of a package,
. package information,
. addition and extraction of contents,
. send the package to a device.
